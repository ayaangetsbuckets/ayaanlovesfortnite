      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Ayaan</strong>. I’m 15 years old and attend Whitney High School. 
      One of my biggest passions outside of school is playing basketball. I’ve built this site to share a little about myself and also help anyone who wants to get better at basketball.</p>

      <h2>Why Basketball?</h2>
      <p>Basketball is more than just a game for me. It’s a way to stay active, build friendships, and push myself to improve. 
      The sport has taught me teamwork, discipline, and perseverance — skills that also help in school and life.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Get Better</h2>
      <p>Here are some key areas that can make a big difference in your game:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dribbling:</strong> Practice with both hands. Start with basic ball-handling drills like crossovers, figure 8s, and two-ball dribbling.</li>
        <li><strong>Shooting:</strong> Focus on form first. Use the "BEEF" method (Balance, Eyes, Elbow, Follow-through).</li>
        <li><strong>Conditioning:</strong> Run sprints, work on footwork ladders, and do endurance training to keep up your stamina on the court.</li>
        <li><strong>Defense:</strong> Stay low, move your feet quickly, and always watch your opponent’s waist instead of the ball.</li>
      </ul>
